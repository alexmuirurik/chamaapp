## Olive Chama

We're creating a chama app using Laravel and LiveWire for users and admins to manage user accounts, documents, and savings easily. 

We should integrate the app using React Native/Flatter and Rest APIs to allow users to access the app via their mobile devices. 

The user should be able to: 

1. Create a chama and add members to it. After registering using your email and password, create a chama and follow the steps to establish an account for your chama. 

//Todo

2. Following an invite via email, whatsapp, or text message, members should able be able to register for an account and set up their personal information. 
3. Admins should schedule meetings for upcoming chama events or meetings based on their weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly settings. 
4. Users should make a deposit or automate billings via Mpesa or a bank account
5. The system should calculate the funds belonging to the user based on the deposit and settings
6. Request loans and the admin can add loans offered offline to the registry
7. Get rewards for profit based on their shares or savings via Mpesa or their bank at the end of the year when all users when all users pay their debts.
